## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence? {#what-is-ai}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

### Key Characteristics of AI:

1. **Learning**: The ability to improve performance through experience
2. **Reasoning**: The capacity to solve problems through logical deduction
3. **Perception**: The ability to interpret sensory data
4. **Language Understanding**: Comprehension and generation of natural language
5. **Creativity**: The capability to generate novel solutions or content

### Types of AI:

#### Narrow AI (Weak AI)
- Designed for specific tasks
- Examples: Chess programs, voice assistants, recommendation systems
- Current state of most AI applications

#### General AI (Strong AI)
- Human-level intelligence across all domains
- Theoretical concept, not yet achieved
- Goal of long-term AI research

#### Artificial Superintelligence
- Intelligence surpassing human capabilities
- Speculative future possibility
- Subject of ongoing research and debate

### AI Domains:

```python
# Example: Simple AI decision making
class SimpleAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = {
            'weather': ['sunny', 'rainy', 'cloudy'],
            'activities': {
                'sunny': ['beach', 'hiking', 'picnic'],
                'rainy': ['movies', 'reading', 'indoor games'],
                'cloudy': ['walking', 'shopping', 'cafe']
            }
        }
    
    def recommend_activity(self, weather):
        """Simple AI recommendation system"""
        if weather in self.knowledge_base['activities']:
            activities = self.knowledge_base['activities'][weather]
            return f"For {weather} weather, I recommend: {', '.join(activities)}"
        else:
            return "Sorry, I don't have recommendations for this weather."

# Usage
ai_assistant = SimpleAI()
print(ai_assistant.recommend_activity('sunny'))
# Output: For sunny weather, I recommend: beach, hiking, picnic
```

## 2. Understanding Machine Learning {#understanding-ml}

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way humans learn, gradually improving accuracy without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

### Core Concepts:

#### Data
- The fuel that powers ML algorithms
- Can be structured (databases) or unstructured (text, images)
- Quality and quantity both matter

#### Algorithms
- Mathematical procedures for finding patterns in data
- Different algorithms suit different types of problems
- Examples: Linear regression, decision trees, neural networks

#### Models
- The result of training an algorithm on data
- Can make predictions on new, unseen data
- Require evaluation and validation

### The ML Process:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simple ML workflow example
def demonstrate_ml_process():
    """Demonstrate the basic ML process"""
    
    # 1. Generate sample data
    np.random.seed(42)
    X = np.random.randn(100, 1) * 10  # Features
    y = 2 * X.flatten() + 3 + np.random.randn(100) * 2  # Target with noise
    
    # 2. Split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
    )
    
    # 3. Train model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # 4. Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # 5. Evaluate
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")
    
    # 6. Visualize
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='blue', alpha=0.6, label='Actual')
    plt.scatter(X_test, y_pred, color='red', alpha=0.6, label='Predicted')
    plt.xlabel('Feature')
    plt.ylabel('Target')
    plt.title('ML Prediction Results')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
    
    return model

# Run the demonstration
model = demonstrate_ml_process()
```

## 3. Types of Machine Learning {#types-of-ml}

### Supervised Learning

Learning with labeled examples where the correct answer is provided during training.

**Characteristics:**
- Input-output pairs available
- Goal: Learn mapping from inputs to outputs
- Performance measured on accuracy of predictions

**Types:**
- **Classification**: Predicting categories (spam/not spam, cat/dog)
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (house prices, temperature)

**Examples:**
```python
# Classification example
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load sample data
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42
)

# Train classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Classification Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

### Unsupervised Learning

Learning patterns from data without labeled examples.

**Characteristics:**
- No target variable provided
- Goal: Discover hidden patterns in data
- More exploratory in nature

**Types:**
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplifying data while preserving information
- **Association Rules**: Finding relationships between variables

**Examples:**
```python
# Clustering example
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

# Generate sample data
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.60, random_state=0)

# Apply clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=0)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Visualize results
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=clusters, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.6)
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], 
           c='red', marker='x', s=200, linewidths=3)
plt.title('K-Means Clustering')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.show()
```

### Reinforcement Learning

Learning through interaction with an environment using rewards and punishments.

**Characteristics:**
- Agent learns by taking actions
- Receives feedback through rewards/penalties
- Goal: Maximize cumulative reward

**Applications:**
- Game playing (Chess, Go)
- Robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Trading algorithms

### Semi-Supervised Learning

Combines supervised and unsupervised learning using both labeled and unlabeled data.

**Use Cases:**
- When labeling data is expensive
- Large amounts of unlabeled data available
- Improves performance over purely supervised methods

        elif cholesterol >= self.risk_factors['cholesterol']['medium']:
            risk_score += 1
        
        # Determine risk level
